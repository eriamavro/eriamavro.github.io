# About Me

Hello, my name is **Eri Adachi**.

I am a Senior Compositor with over 19 years of experience in the visual effects industry, working on both Hollywood feature films and streaming series. I specialize in high-quality compositing, primarily using Foundry Nuke, and have collaborated with teams across the globe in fast-paced production environments.

Over the years, Iâ€™ve contributed to a wide range of projects, adapting to evolving workflows, tools, and creative challenges. Iâ€™m passionate about storytelling through visuals and bring consistency, technical insight, and a collaborative spirit to every production I join.

Currently, Iâ€™m working on immersive installations, digital experiences, and large-scale visual environments â€” expanding my expertise beyond traditional film and TV into experiential media.
